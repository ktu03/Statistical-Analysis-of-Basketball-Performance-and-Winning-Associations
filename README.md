# Statistical Analysis of Basketball Performance and Winning Associations

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and explore which team- and player-level variables are most strongly associated with performance and game outcomes through examining differences in metrics between winning and losing teams and players.

## Team-Level Analysis

The team-level analysis consists of 3 components: data wrangling (Main.ipynb), visualization analysis (Visualization Analysis (Team-Level), and statistical modelling (Statistical Modelling (Team-Level)). To avoid scrolling sideways in the ipynb files, HTML files are available below.
